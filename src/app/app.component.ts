This will keep the jars off the bottom of the pot so they don't break. Fill the pot with water and bring to a rolling boil.",
      "Now using very clean hands, place the cherries in the jars with 3/4 inch of head space left over. Pour the simple syrup over the cherries (still leaving that 3/4 inch of space at the top and spoon 1 to 2 Oz of bourbon over the entire mixture. This should leave you with 1/2\" of head space.",

Carefully remove from the water with a pair of tongs with rubber bands wrapped around the ends to prevent slippage, and allow to set. You may hear a \"ping\" noise coming from the jars - this is an excellent sign. Once cool, check to make sure the rings have in fact sealed and refrigerate any that don't. While you should use unsealed cherries within a couple weeks, the sealed ones will last you a very long time.",
